4. When prompted to scan QR Code, 
	- show good profile.jpeg to be granted access
			-OR-
	- show bad profile.jpeg to be denied access

5. As for the temperature, as we do not have the resources to measure temperature through either a FLIR camera or a regular laser temperature scanner, manual temperature is required as a placeholder. (only allows under 37C)

6. Details of the individual's name, vaccination status, health status and temperature will be displayed and whether or not access is granted based on their status.

7. To generate a .csv of the statistics data, we have included a "Statistics Generate.html" to generate a .csv with placeholder data.
