DISCLAIMER:

This web app is partly hardcoded as we have not managed to code the whole thing. The css was also styled for 1000px x 1000px resolution only as a responsive application was not needed.

good profile.jpeg and bad profile.jpeg are fake MySejahtera QR Codes used only for demonstration
purposes in Round 2. 

good profile.jpeg represents an individual's MySejahtera profile that
is vaccinated with a low risk health status, whilst bad profile.jpeg represents an 
unvaccinated profile with a high risk health status.



**Below are the steps to use our minimum viable product:

1. Download all of the files in the repository and open the index.html file downloaded on the browser.

2. Set the display resolution to 1000px x 1000px.

3. To start, click on the screen.

4. When prompted to scan QR Code, 
	- show good profile.jpeg to be granted access
			-OR-
	- show bad profile.jpeg to be denied access

5. Allow a few seconds to pass when scanning temperature.

6. Details of the individual's name, vaccination status, health status and temperature
   will be displayed and whether or not access is granted based on their status.
